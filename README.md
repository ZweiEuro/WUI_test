- make custom scheme so backend can be navigated more cleanly (html things)
- setup development set for some data
- Fix renderer to only convert pixel data in designated rect sizes and not full buffer (data bottleneck)
- parse mouse input modifiers, strg/ctrl/shift click
- parse windows specific system keys?
- forward key events to the UI, and back if interaction wasn't consumed
- make the renderer of allegro independent thread from main (create display in that new thread and manage it internally)
- handle mouse wheel events
- separate game object management from the renderer
- Smarter object instantiation and backend Rendering things in general (make some kind of demo game out of this)
- Reactive window resizing and adjustment of backbuffer and pipeline
- Work out JS <-> Engine bidirectional binding and function subscriptions, event based system
  - JS and Engine should both be able to subscribe to events sent from the other party in some generalistic manner
  - most likely use the global window object since that can be injected cleanly.
- hot reloading test
- complex css styling test
- Reactive, compressed, webpack, jest, etc compatability test (though this should all pass)
